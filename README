This repo is a test environment for developing and validating improvements to the xml-fortran library for use in OpenMC.

v0/ contains xml-fortran from 'develop' branch of OpenMC

v1/ contains xml-fortran from xml_array_resize branch of Ron's OpenMC fork;
IMPROVMENTS: array reallocation is handled like a binary tree.  (in v0, array
reallocation was simply incremented at each step)

v2/ contains optimizations for buffer sizes: 
IMPROVEMENTS:  (a) all improvements from v1; (b) In xmlparse.f90, the line
buffer is replaced with an iso_varying_string, so it may handle lines of
arbitrary length.  (c) xmlreader produces parsers in which the data buffer
(i.e.: the buffer that multiple lines of data between start and end tags)
handles up to 100K lines (NOTE: this is still static).  (d) In
read_xml_array.inc, the data buffer (a string which concatenates all the data
lines in (c)) is an iso_varying_string, so it may handle arbitrary lengths.

v3/ contains optimizations for buffer sizes 
IMPROVEMENTS:  all improvments from v1; and improvements (c) and (d) from v2
Improvment v2(b) was a red herring, as the line length was not a limiting
factor
